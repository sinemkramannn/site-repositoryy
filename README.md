# User Management Page

This project represents a user management web page, providing functionality for adding new users, viewing existing users, and editing user details. Users can also hide disabled users from the view.

## Overview

The page layout is divided into two main sections:

- **Left Half:** Displays a table containing existing users. Users can click the "+ New User" button to fill out the form for adding a new user. Additionally, they can hide disabled users by checking the "Hide Disabled User" checkbox.
  
- **Right Half:** Contains a form with fields necessary to add a new user. Users are expected to input the username, display name, phone number, email, and user roles. There's also an option to enable or disable the user.

## User Interactions

- **"+ New User" Button:** Clicking this button opens a form for adding a new user.
  
- **Form Fields:** Include mandatory fields for users to input new user details.
  
- **"Hide Disabled User" Checkbox:** When checked, disabled users are not displayed in the table.

## Additional Information

- User ID is generated automatically and cannot be edited.
  
- User input data (email format, phone number format) should be validated for correctness.
